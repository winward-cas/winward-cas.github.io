        Winward Casino - a few things to keep in mind
      </h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to Winward Casino bonus terms, there are a few things to keep in mind. A very important point is the minimum deposit. At Winward Casino, you need to deposit at least 20 euros. Smaller amounts do not qualify for the activation of the casino bonus.

By the way: you do not need a <a href="https://winwardcasinoonline.com/" target="_blank">winward casino online</a> bonus code to activate the promotional benefit, but you must contact customer service - either via email or live chat.

The time window for free spins is 10 days compared to other casino bonus offers . Note: Keep in mind that video poker or roulette and blackjack bets do not count toward the wagering requirements of Winward Casino bonuses.

In addition to the welcome bonus, Winward Casino - and this is what sets the casino apart from others - has a very wide range of offers for existing customers. So, you can get a different deposit bonus every week. At the beginning of the week, there's an opportunity to sweeten the new week with 50 free spins. Or how about a weekend with a 700 euro bonus. As a relay, you use a 50% bonus on a â‚¬20 deposit. Casino cashback and loyalty points are two more features you won't find at every online casino.

        In the Winward Casino test, the question of how credit can be deposited into a customer's account should matter. And, of course, every casino fan wonders about the withdrawal process. The key point in this context, of course, is the cashier area (often referred to as the cashier). Various payment methods are available here for deposits and withdrawals.

In the Winward Casino test, some old friends immediately stand out. These payment methods have largely dominated the iGaming scene. This includes bank transfers and credit cards, for example. However, the use of electronic wallets (e-wallets) is also popular. Payment services have the advantage of easy processing and fast credits.

In addition, there are monthly withdrawal limits. Their number is determined by their status. At level 1, the limit is 10,000 euros, at level 5 - 50,000 euros. In addition, with regard to the checkout area, it should be noted that some payment methods are not represented. This applies in particular to PayPal, so Winward Casino does not fall into the group of casinos PayPal .

       In the eyes of many casino fans, security is particularly important. Of course, the possibility of losing is part of that. However, don't let it get ripped off. Online casinos without a permit are viewed critically. With this in mind, it becomes clear why a license has become so important.

Winward Casino operates under an official Curacao license. The island state has been known for years as the location of many iGaming providers. Means: the authorities have extensive experience in supporting and licensing online casinos. 

Regarding the issue of Winward Casino fraud, licensing is an important consideration for a number of reasons. Among other things, it's a question of how fairly customers are treated - for example, when there are problems with payouts. Or in what form the random number generator (RNG) benefits the casino. Just two aspects that should matter in the context of licensing.

So far, Winward Casino seems to have only relied on a gaming license from Curacao - and thus goes a slightly different route than its competitors. Background: many online casinos are now trying to obtain various licenses - for example from the Malta Gambling Authority . Thus, an attempt is being made to secure gambling operations in all possible areas.

        The topic of customer service can quickly get sidetracked. After all, one wants to get to work right away after registering. To find out if fraud at Winward Casino is really a danger, contact customer service. No dubious scammer will take the trouble to set up a multilingual customer service.

There is another positive thing about the Winward Casino Scam test. There is even a separate hotline for customers from Europe where you can directly contact online casino support.

The hotline can be called Monday through Friday from 10:00 to 20:00 (GMT + 3). In addition, Winward Casino has developed a FAQ. Here's some basic information about registering or making a deposit. If you run into any particular problem that requires a customized solution, you're unlikely to be able to get by without support.
